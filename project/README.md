# Investment Calculator

This Python script calculates the future value of investments based on various parameters, including starting amount, return rate, compounding frequency, additional contributions, and contribution frequency. The script provides two methods for calculating the total investment: one based on a single initial investment and another based on Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA).

## Features

- **Single Investment Calculation:** Calculate the future value of a single investment over a specified period, considering compounding interest.

- **Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Calculation:** Estimate the future value of investments made through DCA, including reinvestments over multiple terms.
